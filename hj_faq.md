## ❓ Dancer gets scratched mid-heat (e.g., gets sick after the first song)
**Situation:** A dancer must leave the floor during or right after the first song due to illness or injury.

**Answer:**  
**Bring in a replacement partner.**  
The replacement dancer only ensures that the round continues fairly and **is not judged** (because they did not complete the required 3 dances).

**Important:**
- Do **not** give the affected dancer an extra song.
- Do **not** shift dancers between heats to compensate.
- The replacement exists solely to ensure all remaining dancers receive **three full dances** under fair conditions.

## ❓ Music issues (song stops, skips, or audio failure)
**Answer:**  
**Stop the song immediately**, wait briefly, and **play a new full song**.  
Any partial song before the failure **must not be judged**.

## ❓ A judge feels unwell or must leave during a heat
**Answer:**  
The Head Judge decides:
- Continue the heat with one fewer judge (acceptable with larger panels with more then 4 required judges), **or**
- Pause the heat briefly and assign a replacement judge - this can be done if it happens in the first heat at song number 1.

Priority: **Judging consistency**.

## ❓ A competitor misses their heat
**Answer:**  
If it is logistically possible: **move them into a later heat**.  
If not: **scratch as a no-show**.
If you have a feeling, that it was on purpose or the fault of the competitor, then it's a scratch.

## ❓ Complaints about random partner assignment or dance order
**Answer:**  
Explain briefly:  
“Pairings are assigned randomly, and everyone receives the same conditions: three partners and three songs.”  
No individual adjustments should be made.

---

## ❓ Judges request different music lengths mid-event
**Answer:**  
All decisions about music length and DJ coordination must be set **before the event starts**.  
No changes should be made once the competition is running.
The headjudge can request to make the song longer, if the judges haven't finished or add a 4th song. In that case a 4th song must be played in every heat.
