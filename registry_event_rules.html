<h2>WSDC Registry Event Rules</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>WSDC</h4>
The World Swing Dance Council (WSDC) is a non-profit organization focused on promoting and growing swing dance at a national and global level. Its mission is, “Guided by the belief that every life is enriched by dance, we aspire to foster swing dancing around the world.”

The WSDC respects the interests of both new and existing members of the entire swing dance community. As a governing body of WSDC Registry Events (“Registry Events”), the WSDC Board of Directors (“Board”) has developed these Registry Event rules to ensure integrity, consistency and fairness at Registry Events.
<h4>Registry Events</h4>
Registry Events are swing dance events organized and hosted by Professional Members (“Members”) of the WSDC and approved by its Board. Registry Events must meet standards set by the WSDC Board, demonstrating integrity and the highest ethical standards; sufficient event size, scope, and structure; and financial viability and stability. Registry Events offer a mix of social dancing, instruction and competition, bringing together local, regional, national and global dancers.

WSDC Registry Event Rules govern the entire Registry Event, not just WSDC Jack and Jill contests. All Registry Events must hold WSDC Jack and Jill contests. The WSDC tracks the contest results for WSDC Jack and Jill competitions at Registry Events; points awarded for placements are included in the WSDC Points Registry.
<h4>Points Registry</h4>
The WSDC Points Registry was developed and is maintained by the WSDC. The Points Registry is the official record used to track individual competitors’ results in WSDC Jack and Jill competitions at Registry Events. The Points Registry is used to determine a competitor’s appropriate skill level for WSDC Jack and Jill competitions. The Points Registry also tracks age- based levels: Juniors, Sophisticated, and Masters.

Competitors who have earned at least one WSDC Jack and Jill competition point are assigned a unique WSDC Competitor ID number in the Points Registry. The Points Registry is available at <a href="https://worldsdc.com/registry-points">worldsdc.com/registry-points</a>.
<h3>Section 1: Registry Events Structure and Ownership</h3>
The following section outlines the minimum standards and requirements for Registry Events.

Membership and Registry Event approval / denial, rule changes, and penalties shall be at the discretion of the Board.
<h4>1.1. Professional Membership</h4>
All Registry Events must be owned by Professional Members of the WSDC. Members may be individuals, groups, clubs (e.g., swing dance clubs), or organizations. Members must remain in good standing by completing the following:

<h4 id="1.4">1.4 Existing Registry Events</h4>
<h5 id="1.4.1">1.4.1 Registry Event Changes:</h5>
All changes in ownership, event name, location, venue, and/or date of a Registry Event are subject to the approval of the Board. Prior to a proposed change, the Member shall meet the following requirements:
<ol>
 	<li data-list-text="1.">The Board must be notified of the proposed change(s) six (6) months prior to the Registry Event.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="2.">A proposed event location or date change must not create a new conflict to the Time / Distance Rule (see “Time / Distance Rule" definition in <a href="#1.3.1.1c">Section 1.3.1 #1c</a>).</li>
 	<li data-list-text="3.">During the first two (2) years of running an event as a Registry Event, the original Owner(s) must retain at least 50% ownership or WSDC status will not transfer to the new Owners.</li>
</ol>
The following exceptions do not require Board approval but Board must still be notified:
<ol>
 	<li data-list-text="1.">A one (1) week change before / after an event’s original weekend. Registry Events associated with a specific date / holiday may be held either the weekend before / after that specific date / holiday.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="2.">A change from one city to another city in the same metropolitan area (and within a reasonable distance) will not be considered a change in location.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 Registry Event Hiatus:</h5>
Registry Events are permitted a one (1) year break without jeopardizing their Registry Event status. New Registry Events must hold two (2) Registry Events before being eligible for hiatus. Hiatus may be a cancellation of the current or upcoming year. The event may be listed on the WSDC Events Calendar with a note that the event is on hiatus. Registry Events on hiatus will keep their date and location on the WSDC Events Calendar for assessing Time / Distance Rule conflicts (see “Time / Distance Rule" definition in Section <a href="#1.3.1.1c">1.3.1 #1c</a>).

Note: Registry Event cancellations in 2020-2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic are not considered an event hiatus by the Board.

A one (1) year break is automatically allowed by the Board if the following criteria are met:
<ol>
 	<li data-list-text="1.">Members notify the Board that their Registry Event is on hiatus for the current or following year in advance.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="2.">Members maintain their WSDC Professional Membership during the hiatus (i.e., Members pay their membership fee). Members will receive no partial or full refunds for a canceled event.</li>
</ol>
Post-hiatus, an event must complete a minimum of two (2) consecutive Registry Events before it may go on hiatus again. If no event is held in the year following the break (i.e., the event is not held for two (2) consecutive years), the event will lose its Registry Event status. Members would need to reapply for Registry Event status, including holding a new Trial Event.
<h3>Section 2: Membership Dues, Competition Surcharges, and Competitor Results Reporting</h3>
<h4 id="2.1">2.1 Membership Dues</h4>
Members must pay annual Professional Membership dues as established by the Board. Membership fees include the right to hold one (1) Registry Event (“Primary Event”). Dues are set as follows:
<ol>
 	<li data-list-text="1.">Initial membership application fee: $200.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="2.">Membership renewal fee: $200 annually, due after the close of a Member’s Primary Event.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="3.">Secondary Event(s) fee: $100 upon approval as a Registry Event; $100 annually for each Secondary Event, due after the close of each Secondary Event.</li>
</ol>
Late submission of Membership Dues may result in penalties (see Chart 1: Penalty Chart for Late Membership Fees / Late Competitor Surcharge).

<h4 id="2.2">2.2. Competitor Surcharge</h4>
Members must pay a Competitor Surcharge to the WSDC for each competitor’s entry into WSDC Jack and Jill competitions. Competitors entering multiple WSDC contests would result in a Competitor Surcharge for each WSDC Jack and Jill contest (e.g., a competitor entering an Advanced as Follower; Intermediate as Leader; and Masters WSDC Jack and Jill contests would result in a $3 Competitor Surcharge). The Competitor Surcharge is due within 30 days after the close of the Registry Event. The Competitor Surcharge is set as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>$1 per competitor entry, per contest entered in WSDC Jack and Jill contest</li>
</ul>
Late submission of Competitor Surcharge may result in penalties (see Chart 1: Penalty Chart for Late Membership Fees / Late Competitor Surcharge).
<h4>2.3. Competitor Results Reporting</h4>
Members must report results for all WSDC Jack and Jill competitions to the WSDC, using the WSDC Event Reporting Form, including the following information:
<ul>
 	<li>All petitions.</li>
 	<li>Competitors’ WSDC ID numbers (if assigned by the Points Registry) should be included.</li>
 	<li>The number of competitors in each division, so the appropriate Tier level for recording points can be determined.</li>
 	<li>List of all unique competitors registered in WSDC Jack and Jill contests.</li>
</ul>
The Event Director and/or the Chief Judge shall verify contest results and the number of contestants.

Competition results are due to the WSDC at the <b>close</b> of the Registry Event, and <b>no later than three (3) days</b> after the event closes. Submission of contest results within a timely manner is required out of respect for our competitors, so the Points Registry is current for upcoming Registry Events.

Late submission of competition results may result in penalties (see Chart 2: Penalty Chart for Late Submission of Competition Results).

<h4 id="3.3">3.3. Contest Tiers, Points Awarded, and Competition Rounds</h4>
<h5>3.3.1. Point Tier Awards</h5>
Tiers are defined by the number of unique competitors in each role (Leader or Follower). Dancing in finals does not guarantee that a competitor will be awarded points. Points awarded to leaders and followers may not be identical. The higher the number of competitors within a division, the higher the Tier, and the greater the points potential.

A division may have different tiers for Leaders and Followers. For example, a Novice contest may have 18 Leaders and 35 Followers. Leaders would receive Tier 2 points; Followers would receive Tier 3 points. The points awarded to a competitor according to their placement in finals is listed in Chart 4.

WSDC Jack and Jill competitions must have a minimum of five (5) unique Leaders and five (5) unique Followers in finals for points to be awarded and the results to be included in the Points Registry.

<h4>3.4. Contest Oversight: Staff Requirements, Conflicts of Interest, Scoring</h4>
Registry Events should follow the highest ethical standards regarding the conduct of contests. Flagrant disregard of ethical standards, even if not specifically outlined in the Registry Event Rules, are grounds for penalties by the Board. Contest oversight requirements apply to all contests held at the event, except where stated otherwise.

Note: For the purposes of this section, Event Director and Owner are defined as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Event Director is any person involved in a strategic planning or decision-making role related to the hiring of judges and/or scoring staff.</li>
 	<li>Owner is any person with &gt;20% ownership in the event.</li>
</ul>
Registry Events must follow all contest oversight requirements outlined below, unless otherwise approved by the Board:
<ol id="l53">
 	<li data-list-text="1.">Event Director and/or Owner must not perform Chief Judge, Judge, or Scoring functions or duties.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="2.">Event Director, Owner, Chief Judge, and Score person (or Contest Administrator with automated scoring systems) must not compete in any swing contests at the event, with the following exceptions:

<ol id="l54">

 	<li data-list-text="a.">Exhibitions only.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="b.">Any contest of a different dance genre and/or sponsored and run by a separate organization. Exceptions must be authorized by the Board prior to the event.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="c.">At <abbr TITLE="United Country Western Dance Council">UCWDC</abbr> events only, Event Director, Owner, Chief Judge, and Score person may dance in a UCWDC Pro-Am West Coast Swing contest. This exception is allowed since it is permitted under UCWDC rules.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="3.">Chief Judge and Scoring / Tabulation functions and duties must be provided by separate individuals.

<ol id="l55">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">An Assistant Chief Judge may assist the Chief Judge and is subject to the same Chief Judge requirements.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="4.">Judges must make decisions independently.

<ol id="l56">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">Group judging decisions (instantaneous “on the floor”), tap out” eliminations during the contest (by an individual judge or as a group), or audience-judging are permitted only in “fun” contests (e.g., “Sweet Sixteen”-type contests, costume contests). Final results must be awarded “on the spot.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="5."><b>All real and/or perceived biases must be identified and avoided.</b> All issues of bias or conflict (e.g., positive / negative favoritism, personal (family, spouse, significant other), business, or dance partners) between competitors and any judge or Chief Judge should be submitted to the Chief Judge and/or Event Director. Judging assignments must be made to avoid potential conflicts. Judges / Chief Judges must excuse themselves from a judging panel to avoid conflicts; when necessary for a specific contest, the Chief Judge may be replaced by the Assistant Chief Judge or an appointed Judge (a separate judge who is not on that contest’s judging panel).

<ol id="l57">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">Exceptions are allowed for Pro-Am Jack and Jill and Pro-Am Strictly Swing competitions when judges are judging the Amateurs only.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="6.">Judges for contests must meet the following standards:

<ol id="l58">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">For <b>preliminary Jack and Jill contests</b>, a minimum of six (6) judges (plus Chief Judge) are required. A minimum of three (3) judges shall be assigned to each role. The WSDC recommends Registry Events use four to five (4-5) judges per role in preliminary contests to get more consistent results. The following exceptions are allowed:

<ol id="l59">
 	<li data-list-text="i.">Where there are 15 or fewer couples, events may use three to five (3-5) judges. Judges must judge both roles.
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="ii.">Where there are 16-20 couples, events may use five to seven (5-7) judges. Judges must judge both roles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="b.">For <b>final Jack and Jill contests</b>, a minimum of five (5) judges (plus Chief Judge) are required. An even number of judges shall not be used. The WSDC recommends Registry Events use seven (7) judges for finals.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="c.">The Chief Judge may join the general judging panel only if there is an unforeseen / unavoidable shortage of general judges.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="d.">Self-judging contests are allowed only in the Champions division. Self-judging should occur only if there is an insufficient number of available judges.</li>
 	<li data-list-text="e.">Virtual judging is not permitted.</li>
</ol>
</li>

 	<li data-list-text="7.">Contests must use the Callback System for preliminary competitions and Relative Placement scoring system for finals.

<ol id="l60">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">The Callback System for preliminary competitions has been standardized. The following point values must be assigned to judges’ callbacks: Yes = 10; Alternate 1 (Alt 1) = 4.5; Alternate 2 = 4.3; Alternate 3 = 4.2; No = 0. The outcome for callbacks must be determined by the sum of the values.

<ol id="l61">
 	<li data-list-text="i.">Scoring systems should not use more than 3 levels of Alternates (e.g., no Alternate 4).</li>
 	<li data-list-text="ii.">At their discretion, the Chief Judge may ask judges to use only Alt 1s or Alt 1s &amp; Alt 2s instead of Alt 1, Alt 2 &amp; Alt 3s, for any specific contest. In larger contests, if more alternates are desired, the Chief judge may ask for two or more Alt 1s; Alt 1 &amp; Alt 2s; or Alt 1, Alt 2, &amp; Alt 3s.</li>

 	<li data-list-text="iii.">In the event of a tie, the Chief Judge breaks the tie.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="b.">Chief Judges must assign raw scores to all competitors in preliminary rounds. If necessary, the Chief Judge may raw score one role and assign an Assistant Chief Judge or appointed Judge to raw score the other role (e.g., Chief Judge scores Leaders; Assistant Chief Judge/appointed Judge scores Followers).</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="8.">Contests must maintain the integrity of random and unbiased selection.

<ol id="l62">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">Rotations (e.g., in preliminary heats) shall be determined at random (e.g., roll of dice, drawing of number cards, random number generator).
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="b.">The pairing of partners in finals and determining the order of dance shall be random (e.g., drawing dance partner names and/or dance order shall be done “on the floor,” random computer function).</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li data-list-text="9.">Contest scoring shall be computerized and tabulated using the Callback and Relative Placement scoring systems. Information on Relative Placement is available on the Education section under Rules &amp; Info on the WSDC website.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="4">Section 4: WSDC Enforcement Policy and Penalties</h3>

<p>The WSDC recommends that all events have a Code of Conduct policy. A suggested policy is available on the Code of Conduct section under Rules &amp; Info on the WSDC website.</p>

<p>Registry Event rules are enforced by the WSDC Board. Unless otherwise approved, any WSDC Professional Member or Registry Event that does not comply with the WSDC Registry Event Rules will be considered in default of their membership and subject to penalties and/or loss of Registry Event status.</p>

<p>Members who violate Registry Event rules, including late submission of their Membership dues, Competitor Surcharge, or competition results, will be in default. Default may result one or more of the following options:</p>

<ol id="l63">
 	<li data-list-text="1.">Warning</li>
 	<li data-list-text="2.">Fine</li>
 	<li data-list-text="3.">Probation</li>
 	<li data-list-text="4.">Loss of Registry Event status

<ol id="l64">
 	<li data-list-text="a.">Event may be required to reapply for Registry Event approval, including a new Trial Event.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Penalties specific to late submission of Membership fees, Competitor Surcharge, and competition results are detailed in Charts 1 and 2. Penalties for all other Registry Event rules violations are detailed in Chart 6. Members in default may reapply for WSDC membership or Registry Event status, subject to approval by the Board.</p>
