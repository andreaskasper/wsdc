<h2>WSDC Registry Event Rules</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>WSDC</h4>
<p>The World Swing Dance Council (WSDC) is a non-profit organization focused on promoting and growing swing dance at the global level. Its mission is, “To inspire swing dancing around the world and guide events in creating the ideal	environment to promote community growth.”</p>

<p>The WSDC respects the interests of both new and existing members of the entire swing dance community. As a governing	body of WSDC Registry Events (“Registry Events”), the WSDC Board of Directors (“Board”) has developed these	Registry Event rules to ensure integrity, consistency and fairness at Registry Events. </p>

<h4>Registry Events</h4>
<p>Registry Events are swing dance events organized and hosted by Professional Members (“Members”) of the WSDC and approved by its Board. Registry Events must meet standards set by the WSDC Board, demonstrating integrity and the highest ethical standards; sufficient event size, scope, and structure; and financial viability and stability. Registry Events offer a mix of social dancing, instruction and competition, bringing together local, regional, national and international dancers.</p>

<p>WSDC Registry Event Rules govern the entire Registry Event, not just WSDC Jack and Jill contests. All Registry Events must hold WSDC Jack and Jill contests. The WSDC tracks the contest results for WSDC Jack and Jill competitions at Registry Events; points awarded for placements are included in the WSDC Points Registry.</p>

<h4>Points Registry</h4>
<p>The WSDC Points Registry was developed and is maintained by the WSDC. The Points Registry is the official record used to track individual competitors’ results in WSDC Jack and Jill competitions at Registry Events. The Points Registry is used to determine a competitor’s appropriate skill level for WSDC Jack and Jill competitions. The Points Registry tracks the following skill-level and age-based categories: Newcomer, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, All Star, Champions; and Juniors, Sophisticated, and Masters, respectively.</p>

<p>Competitors who have earned at least one WSDC Jack and Jill competition point are assigned a unique WSDC	Competitor ID number in the Points Registry. The Points Registry is available at <a href="https://worldsdc.com/registry-points">worldsdc.com/registry-points</a>.</p>

<h4>Definitions</h4>

<h5 id="definition_venue">Venue</h5>
<p>Registry Events must be held in an approved venue that meets the following minimum requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li data-list-text="1.">Dance floor in main ballroom must be a minimum of 150 sq meters (1600 sq ft).</li>
	<li data-list-text="2.">Recommended accommodations must be available within a 10 min walk or event must provide a shuttle that goes to/from accommodations suggested by event. If the latter, shuttles must run until the end of social dancing and are of sufficient frequency and capacity needed.</li>
	<li data-list-text="3.">Venue must provide full service (food and drink) and/or options must be available nearby.</li>
	<li data-list-text="4.">Studios that meet the above requirements must be approved and have additional restrictions as follows:
		<ol>
			<li data-list-text="i.">A maximum of two (2) Registry Events may be held in the same studio per calendar year.</li>
			<li data-list-text="ii.">A studio owner who is also the Event Owner / Event Director may hold a maximum of one (1) Registry	Event in their studio.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li data-list-text="5.">Registry Events in venues that do not currently meet these requirements have a three (3) year grace period (ending December 31, 2025) to meet the venue minimum requirements. </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="definition_timedistancerule">Time / Distance Rule</h5>
<p><mark>Global Rule:</mark> If the proposed event change (i.e., Trial Event or change to existing Registry Event) is <mark>within 200 miles (322 km)</mark> driving distance of an existing Registry Event(s), then the proposed change and existing Registry Event(s) must be	five (5) weekends apart (i.e., the events must have four (4) weekends between them).</p>

<p>The following exceptions to the Time / Distance Rule <i>may</i> be allowed with Trial Events. <i>All exceptions listed below will require approval by the Board.</i><a id="mark-1"></a><a href="#legend-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<ol>
	<li data-list-text="1."><i>Country-specific rule:</i> The first / only event that is located in a specific country. A majority of the Owner(s) / Event Director(s) must be resident(s) of the country.</li>
	<li data-list-text="2."><i>Exceptional extenuating circumstances:</i> The Board reserves the right to approve Time / Distance Rule conflicts as part of our mission and vision (“focused on promoting and growing swing dance”). Examples are extenuating circumstances, hardship, or local market conditions that warrant approval of an exception.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="definition_growthregion">Designated WSDC Growth Region</h5>
<p>Designated WSDC growth regions for 2025: Asia, Australia/New Zealand, South America/Central America, and Africa.	Additional countries / regions may be added upon request and agreement by the Board.</p>

<h5>Age-based Contests</h5>
<p>Juniors are defined as those younger than 18 years of age by close of the event.<br/>
	Sophisticated are defined as 35 years of age or older by close of the event.<br/>
	Masters are defined as 50 years of age or older by close of the event. </p>

<h5 id="definition_chiefjudge">Chief Judge</h5>
<p>The Chief Judge is responsible for the oversight of the event’s contests and for ensuring the integrity of every contest.
<mark>Chief Judge may not compete (for other limitations and requirements, see <a href="#3.4">Section 3.4: Contest Oversight</a>).</mark></p>

<h5 id="definition_secondarychiefjudge">Secondary Chief Judge</h5>
<p>The Secondary Chief Judge has similar or the same duties and responsibilities as the Chief Judge during the Event, and may replace the Chief Judge as needed. The Secondary Chief Judge is subject to the same rules and restrictions as the	Chief Judge. <mark>Secondary Chief Judge may not compete (for other limitations and requirements, see <a href="#3.4">Section 3.4: Contest Oversight</a>).</mark> Some events may refer to this role as the Co-Chief Judge or Assistant Chief Judge.</p>

<h5 id="definition_rawscorejudge">Raw Score Judge</h5>
<p>A Raw Score Judge is a separate judge, not part of a contest’s judging panel. The Raw Score Judge may be used in a
	contest (or multiple contests) during prelims only, to raw score one role while the Chief Judge is scoring the other role.
	The Raw Score Judge must assign each competitor a unique numerical raw score. The Raw Score Judge does not have
	access to scores and does not determine heats <mark>/ number of callbacks / cuts to finals / any other contest structure decisions;</mark> 
	those duties must be performed by the Chief Judge (or Secondary Chief Judge). The Raw Score Judge is allowed to
	compete in other contests.
</p>

<h5 id="definition_roles"><mark>Primary and Secondary Roles</mark></h5>
<p>For the purpose of these rules, a competitor’s primary and secondary roles are based on the number of points in the
	WSDC Skill Level Jack and Jill Advancement Chart (<a href="#chart3">Chart 3</a>). The primary role is the one in which they have points at a
	higher skill level or, if they have points in both roles at their highest skill level, the one in which they have more points.
	The secondary role is the one in which they have points only at a lower skill level or, if they have points in both roles at
	their highest skill division, the one in which they have fewer points.</p>

</ol>


<h4 id="1.4">1.4. Existing Registry Events</h4>
<h5 id="1.4.1">Registry Event Changes:</h5>
<p><mark>Members to notify Board of proposed change(s) six (6) months prior to Registry Events. Changes are subject to the
	written approval of the Board and include the following:</mark></p>
<ol>
	<li id="1.4.1.1" data-list-text="1.">Transfer of ownership</li>
	<li id="1.4.1.2" data-list-text="2.">New location
		<ol>
			<li id="1.4.1.2a" data-list-text="a.">Exception: An Event <mark>in a hotel</mark> may make a change from one location to another in the same metropolitan

		</ol>
	</li>
	<li id="1.4.1.3" data-list-text="3.">Venue (see <a href="#definition_venue">Definitions: Venue</a>)</li>
	<li id="1.4.1.4" data-list-text="4.">New date
		<ol>
			<li id="1.4.1.4a" data-list-text="a.">Exception: An Event may make a one (1) week change before / after an event’s original weekend without
				Board approval. Registry Events associated with a specific date / holiday may be held either the weekend
				before / after that specific date / holiday.
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li id="1.4.1.5" data-list-text="5.">New event name</a>
</ol>

<p>New event location or date change (unless listed as an exception above) must not create a new conflict to the Time /
	Distance Rule (see <a href="#definition_timedistancerule">Definitions: Time / Distance Rule</a>).</p>

<p>During the first two (2) years of running an event as a Registry Event, the original Owner(s) must retain at least 50%
	ownership or WSDC status will not transfer to the new Owners.</p>


<h5 id="1.4.2">Registry Event Hiatus:</h5>
<p>Registry Events are permitted a one (1) year break without jeopardizing their Registry Event status. New Registry Events
	must hold two (2) Registry Events before being eligible for hiatus. Hiatus may be a cancellation of the current or
	upcoming year. The event may be listed on the WSDC Events Calendar with a note that the event is on hiatus. Registry
	Events on hiatus will keep their date and location on the WSDC Events Calendar for assessing Time / Distance Rule
	conflicts (see <a href="#definition_timedistancerule">Definitions: Time / Distance Rule</a>).</p>

<p>A one (1) year break is automatically allowed by the Board if the following criteria are met:</p>
<ol>
	<li id="1.4.2.1" data-list-text="1.">Members notify the Board that their Registry Event is on hiatus <mark>in writing six (6) months</mark> in advance</li>
	<li id="1.4.2.2" data-list-text="2.">Members maintain their WSDC Professional Membership during the hiatus (i.e., Members pay their membership
		fee). Members will receive no partial or full refunds for a canceled event.</li>
</ol>

<p>Post-hiatus, an event must complete a minimum of two (2) consecutive Registry Events before it may go on hiatus again.
	If no event is held in the year following the break (i.e., the event is not held for two (2) consecutive years), the event will
	lose its Registry Event status. Members would need to reapply for Registry Event status, including holding a new Trial
	Event.</p>



<h3 id="2">Section 2: Membership Fee, Competition Surcharges, and Competitor Results Reporting</h3>

<h4 id="2.1">2.1 Membership Fee</h4>

<p><mark><i>New!</i> Members must pay an annual fee ($200) for each Registry Event. Membership Fee is due within 30 days after the
	close of the Registry Event (invoiced separately from Competitor Surcharge).</mark></p>

<p>Late submission of Membership Fee may result in penalties (see <a href="#chart1">Chart 1: Penalty Chart for Late Membership Fees /
	Competitor Surcharge</a>).</p>

	</tbody>
</table>



<h4 id="2.2">2.2. Competitor Surcharge</h4>

<p>Members must pay a Competitor Surcharge to the WSDC for all competitor entries in WSDC Jack and Jill contests.
	Competitors entering multiple WSDC Jack and Jill contests would result in a Competitor Surcharge for each WSDC Jack
	and Jill contest (e.g., a competitor entering an Advanced as Follower; Intermediate as Leader; and Masters WSDC Jack
	and Jill contests would result in a $3 Competitor Surcharge). The Competitor Surcharge is due within 30 days after the
	close of the Registry Event <mark>(invoiced separately from Membership Fee)</mark>. The Competitor Surcharge is set as follows:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>$1 per competitor entry, per contest entered (WSDC Jack and Jill contests only)<a id="mark-3"></a><a href="#legend-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Late submission of Competitor Surcharge may result in penalties (see <a href="#chart1">Chart 1: Penalty Chart for Late Membership Fees /
	Competitor Surcharge</a>).</p>


<h4>2.3. Competitor Results Reporting</h4>
<p>Members must report results for all WSDC Jack and Jill competitions to the WSDC, using the WSDC Event Reporting
Form, including the following information:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>All petitions.</li>
 	<li>Finalists’ WSDC ID numbers (if assigned by the Points Registry) must be included.</li>
 	<li>The number of competitors in each division, so the appropriate Tier level for recording points can be determined.</li>
 	<li>List of all unique competitors registered in WSDC Jack and Jill contests</li>
</ul>
<p>The Event Director and/or the Chief Judge shall verify contest results and the number of contestants.</p>

<p>Competition results are due to the WSDC at the <b>close</b> of the Registry Event, and <b>no later than three (3) days</b> after the
	event closes. Submission of contest results within a timely manner is required out of respect for our competitors, so the
	Points Registry is current for upcoming Registry Events. </p>

<p>Late submission of competition results may result in penalties (see <a href="#chart2">Chart 2: Penalty Chart for Late Submission of
	Competition Results</a>).</p>

<h4 id="3.3">3.3. Contest Tiers, Points Awarded, and Competition Rounds</h4>
<h5 id="3.3.1">3.3.1. Point Tier Awards</h5>
<p>Tiers are defined by the number of unique competitors in each role (Leader or Follower). Dancing in finals does not
	guarantee that a competitor will be awarded points. Points awarded to Leaders and Followers may not be identical. The
	higher the number of competitors within a division, the higher the Tier, and the greater the points potential.</p>

<p>A division may have different tiers for Leaders and Followers. For example, a Novice contest may have 18 Leaders and
	35 Followers. Leaders would receive Tier 2 points; Followers would receive Tier 3 points. The points awarded to a
	competitor according to their placement in finals is listed in <a href="#chart4">Chart 4</a>.</p>

<p>WSDC Jack and Jill competitions must have a minimum of five (5) unique Leaders and five (5) unique Followers in finals
	for points to be awarded and the results to be included in the Points Registry.</p>

<h3 id="4">Section 4: WSDC Enforcement Policy and Penalties</h3>

<p>All events must implement a Code of Conduct policy <mark>and post it on their website</mark>, with appropriate plans for reporting and
	implementation. Sample policies are linked from the Code of Conduct section under Rules & Info on the WSDC website.</p>

<p>Registry Event rules are enforced by the WSDC. Membership and Registry Event approval / denial, rule changes, and
	penalties shall be at the discretion of the Board. Unless otherwise approved, any WSDC Professional Member or Registry
	Event that does not comply with the WSDC Registry Event Rules will be considered in default of their membership and
	subject to penalties and/or loss of Registry Event status.</p>

<p><mark><i>New!</i> The WSDC is developing a new collaborative process for addressing issues (e.g., rule violations) that occur at
	Registry Events. Events may implement a mutually agreed upon and approved Action Plan to address the issue(s). The
	draft Action Plan addressing the issue should be submitted within 10 days of notice and be approved by both the Event
	and Board within 30-60 days. The Action Plan should address the following:
	<ul>
		<li>What happened</li>
		<li>Who was impacted</li>
		<li>How to repair what happened (including communication plan to impacted parties)</li>
		<li>How to prevent it in the future</li>
		<li>Follow up reporting on implementation of the repair and proposed prevention (accountability follow up)</li>
	</ul>
	</mark>
</p>

<p><mark>When an approved Action Plan is implemented and followed, the Registry Event is no longer considered in violation or in
	default. The Action Plan may be implemented by the Event Owner(s), Event Director(s), the Certified Chief Judge and/or
	other relevant parties.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Members and/or Chief Judges who violate Registry Event rules and/or fail to fully implement the Action Plan will be in
	default. Default may result one or more of the following options:
	<ol>
		<li id="4.1" data-list-text="1.">Warning or Probation</li>
		<li id="4.2" data-list-text="2.">Loss of Registry Event status
			<ol>
				<li id="4.2a" data-list-text="a.">Events who lose status are allowed to reapply for Registry Event approval, including a new Trial Event.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li id="4.3" data-list-text="3.">Drop in or Loss of Certified Chief Judge status</li>
	</ol>	
</mark></p>

<p>Penalties specific to late submission of Membership fees, Competitor Surcharge, and competition results are detailed in
	<a href="#chart1">Charts 1</a> and <a href="#chart2">2</a>. Penalties for all other Registry Event rules violations are detailed in <a href="#chart6">Chart 6</a>. Members in default may

<h3 id="4">Section 5: Callback System for Preliminary Competitions</h3>

<p>The Callback System for preliminary competitions has been standardized. The following point values must be assigned to
	judges’ callbacks: 
	<ul>
		<li>Yes = 10</li>
		<li>Alternate 1 (Alt 1) = 4.5; Alternate 2 = 4.3; Alternate 3 = 4.2</li>
		<li>No = 0.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Scoring systems should not use more than 3 levels of Alternates (i.e., no Alternate 4). At their discretion, the Chief Judge
	may ask judges to use Alt 1s; Alt 1s & Alt 2s; or Alt 1, Alt 2 & Alt 3s for any specific contest. In larger contests, to
	minimize the potential for ties, the Chief Judge may ask for two (2) or more Alt 1s; Alt 1 & Alt 2s; or Alt 1, Alt 2, & Alt
	3s.</p>

<p>The outcome for callbacks must be determined by the sum of the values.
	<ul>
		<li>Only after the original calculations are complete, the Chief Judge’s scores break the tie.</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="6">Section 6: Computerized Scoring System Requirements</h3>

<p>A computerized scoring system should do the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
 	<li id="6.1" data-list-text="1.">Place competitors within the various divisions and contests.</li>
 	<li id="6.2" data-list-text="2.">Create preliminary and finals contest judging sheets with pre-populated information.</li>
 	<li id="6.3" data-list-text="3.">Tabulate and rank callbacks. See Section 5 (Callback System for Preliminary Competitions) on requirements for
		ranking callbacks.</li>
 	<li id="6.4" data-list-text="4.">Create callback announcement sheets.</li>
 	<li id="6.5" data-list-text="5.">Transfer competitors to finals.</li>
 	<li id="6.6" data-list-text="6.">Randomly assign partners (if needed).</li>
 	<li id="6.7" data-list-text="7.">Place paired competitors in random dance order or place competitors in numerical order for “draw for dance
		order,” as needed.</li>
 	<li id="6.8" data-list-text="8.">Tabulate and rank finals contests for placement results.</li>

 	<li id="6.9" data-list-text="9.">Provide limited access to authorized users only, as appropriate (e.g., Chief Judge, judges).</li>

 	<li id="6.10" data-list-text="10.">Prevent tampering and/or changes to results by unauthorized users.</li>
	 <li id="6.11" data-list-text="11.">Provide results / announcement / posting sheets.</li>
